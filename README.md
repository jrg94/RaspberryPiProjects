When flashing the SD card, make sure to do the following so you don't have to look these up later:

1. Remove mouse lag
 Â * Add usbhid.mousepoll=0 to /boot/cmdline.txt
2. Add some overscan to resize the GUI desktop for the TV
3. Install xDRP for Windows Remote Desktop so we can basically negate steps 1 & 2
